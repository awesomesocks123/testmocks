You: TwoSUm
AI: Alright, let's start with the classic Two Sum problem. How would you approach solving it given an array of integers and a target sum? 

What's your initial thought process here?
You: Hello Lets solve twosum 
AI: Great! How would you approach solving the TwoSum problem where you need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target?
You: I thikn there are two ways should i tell uboth?
AI: Sure, go ahead and describe both approaches you're considering. What are the trade-offs between them?
You: lets solve twosum
AI: Great, let's start with your approach. How would you solve the TwoSum problem where you need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target?  

*Remember: I won't give direct answers but will guide you through questioning.*
You: Cool lets do hmm not sure i think there are two wasy to do it?
AI: Interesting - what are the two approaches you're considering for TwoSum?
You: hey there
AI: Hi! Let's start with a classic: given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target. How would you approach this?
You: I would use two approaches, one with dictionary and one with nestedloop 
AI: Interesting - why would you consider both approaches? What are the tradeoffs between them?
